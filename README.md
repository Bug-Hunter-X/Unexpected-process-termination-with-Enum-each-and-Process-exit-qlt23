This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in Elixir when using `Enum.each` with `Process.exit` within the enumeration function. The provided code unexpectedly terminates the process before all elements in the list have been processed. This is because `Process.exit` directly terminates the current process, disrupting the iteration. The solution showcases a safer approach using `Enum.reduce` or a different strategy to handle cases where a specific condition needs to interrupt the iteration without completely terminating the process.
